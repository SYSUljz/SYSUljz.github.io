# Hugo Technical Blog Project

This project is a personal technical explanation blog built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the Ananke theme. You can write articles in Markdown and publish them easily.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Hugo** (if not already):
   ```
brew install hugo
   ```
2. **Run the local server:**
   ```
hugo server -D
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to preview your blog.
3. **Write a new post:**
   ```
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
   ```
   Edit the file in `content/posts/` and set `draft: false` to publish.
4. **Build for production:**
   ```
hugo
   ```
   The static site will be in the `public/` folder.
